## PlanIt

AI that helps students plan work, not do it for them. It turns any assignment prompt into a clear, time‑boxed task plan so you finish on time without cramming.

### What it does
- **Plans without answering**: Converts assignments into concrete steps; never writes content.
- **Schedules smartly**: Distributes tasks from today to the due date.
- **Right-sized tasks**: Realistic minute estimates and daily workload caps.
- **Progress tracking**: Check off tasks; assignments complete automatically when all tasks are done.
- **Flexible input**: Upload PDF/DOCX/TXT or paste text.

### Why it’s different
- **Ethical**: Uses AI to manage time and reduce stress, not to cheat.
- **Actionable**: Small, specific tasks that are easy to start and finish.

### How it works
1. Upload or paste your assignment and set a due date.
2. The app names the assignment and creates ~8–12 guided tasks with time estimates.
3. Work through and check off tasks; when all are complete, the assignment is finished.
